# Churn-Out-Prediction
Predicting the likelihood of churn among mobile telephone subscribers using a balanced data set.

This project was my submission to a data science competition sponsored by the Nigeria Data Science organisation on Kaggle.

The XGBOOST model was used to predict if a customer will continue subscribing to a given mobile network or not based on a set of variables.
